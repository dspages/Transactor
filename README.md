# README

This project allows users to sign up, log in, log out, send credits to other users, and view their current number of credits, and view a record of all past transactions. Normally, you might use a prepackaged Auth solution like OAuth, but for purposes of demonstration I handrolled my own Auth pattern. No CSS styling has yet been performed but the project could easily be given more style.
